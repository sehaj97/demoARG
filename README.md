AxeAccessibilityChecker: Short Description

AxeAccessibilityChecker is a lightweight bookmarklet that instantly scans web pages for accessibility issues using the axe-core library. It provides a visual overlay that highlights violations and offers simple explanations, making it easy for both technical and non-technical users to improve website accessibility.

What Problem It’s Solving

Currently, teams often rely on the axe browser extension, which requires opening developer tools—a barrier for non-technical users. This bookmarklet simplifies accessibility testing by providing immediate feedback directly on the page, improving ease of use and speeding up the auditing process.

Why the Bookmarklet is Better

For Non-Technical Users:

	•	No Dev Tools Required: Avoids the complexity of developer tools, offering a simple, intuitive interface.
	•	Visual Cues: Highlights elements with accessibility issues directly on the page, making it easier to understand what needs attention.

For Technical Users:

	•	Streamlined Workflow: Fast and easy to use, with no need to toggle between dev tools and the page.
	•	Accessibility Anywhere: Easily accessible through the bookmarks bar, making testing faster on any webpage.

Solution Overview

AxeAccessibilityChecker creates an interactive overlay displaying accessibility violations, passes, and items that require manual review. It allows users to visually highlight elements, scroll to issues, and remove highlights—empowering teams to audit accessibility without the need for complex tools.

Benefits Over the Axe Extension

	•	Ease of Use: Runs from a bookmarklet, avoiding the need for dev tools.

	•	User-Friendly: Offers plain language explanations and real-time highlighting, making it suitable for non-technical users.
	•	Versatile for Teams: Ideal for content creators, marketing, and development teams to collaborate on accessibility improvements.

Financing

Resources Needed:

	•	Development Time: 2-3 weeks for implementation and refinement of the bookmarklet.
	•	Team Involvement: 1-2 developers to build and test the tool; additional input from content and design teams to ensure user-friendly messaging.
	•	Cost of Development: Low, as it’s built using open-source libraries like axe-core and can be deployed without external dependencies.

Cost of Execution:

	•	Minimal Financial Investment: The bookmarklet leverages existing infrastructure (browser bookmarklet functionality), requiring no additional software or licensing costs.
	•	Training Time: Minimal time needed for training due to its ease of use; even non-technical team members can be onboarded quickly.

Financial Benefits:

	•	Reduced Legal Risks: By ensuring that accessibility issues are promptly identified and fixed, the tool helps avoid costly legal actions due to non-compliance with regulations such as the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) or WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).
	•	Cost Avoidance: Prevents potential fines, lawsuits, and the need for expensive post-launch fixes by identifying issues early in the development cycle.
	•	Improved Customer Experience: Increases customer satisfaction and accessibility, leading to higher conversion rates and potentially expanding the customer base by catering to users with disabilities.

Cost Avoidance:

	•	Efficiency Gains: The bookmarklet reduces the time developers and testers spend navigating dev tools and extensions, enabling faster issue resolution.
	•	Lower Training Costs: Due to the simplified interface, less training is required for non-technical team members, saving onboarding and resource costs.
	•	Prevention of Major Redesigns: Identifying accessibility issues early avoids costly redesigns, minimizing disruptions and ensuring smoother workflows.

In sum, AxeAccessibilityChecker is a cost-effective solution that not only improves website accessibility but also delivers substantial financial benefits by reducing legal risks, improving efficiency, and enhancing the overall user experience.
