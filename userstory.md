User Story: AxeAccessibilityChecker Bookmarklet

Title:

As a user, I want to quickly and easily analyze a webpage for accessibility issues without using developer tools, so that I can identify and address accessibility violations in a more efficient and user-friendly manner.

Description:

We need to create a bookmarklet that performs an accessibility audit using the axe-core library. The tool should generate an interactive overlay on the webpage that displays accessibility violations, passes, and elements requiring manual review. It should allow users to visually highlight elements on the page, and the interface should be simple enough for both technical and non-technical users to navigate.

Acceptance Criteria:

	1.	Functionality:
	•	The bookmarklet can be added to any browser and runs directly from the bookmarks bar.
	•	Upon clicking the bookmarklet, the axe-core accessibility audit runs on the current webpage.
	•	An overlay is displayed with the following sections:
	•	Accessibility Violations
	•	Passes (compliant elements)
	•	Items Needing Manual Review
	•	Inapplicable Rules
	•	Each item within the sections can be expanded to show more details about the issue or passed element.
	•	Each issue or passed element should have an option to highlight the affected HTML element on the webpage.
	•	The bookmarklet should provide a “Highlight All Violations” button that highlights all accessibility violations on the page at once.
	•	A “Remove All Highlights” button should be included to clear all highlighted elements.
	•	The “Close” button should remove the overlay, as well as all highlights, and all other dynamically added buttons.
	2.	User Interface:
	•	The overlay should be designed for ease of use, using plain language to explain accessibility issues.
	•	The bookmarklet should highlight HTML elements with accessibility violations in a clear and visible way (e.g., a red border).
	•	The close button should remain sticky as users scroll through the overlay content.
	•	The interface should be responsive and user-friendly for both technical and non-technical users.
	3.	Technical:
	•	The bookmarklet should use the latest version of the axe-core library (via CDN).
	•	The bookmarklet should work across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
	•	The tool should handle iframes and shadow DOM elements during accessibility checks.
	•	Ensure that the bookmarklet runs efficiently on webpages of varying sizes and structures.
	4.	Error Handling:
	•	The bookmarklet should handle errors gracefully, displaying a message if it fails to fetch or analyze the page.
	•	Any elements that cannot be highlighted (e.g., due to cross-origin iframe issues) should disable the “Highlight Element” option with a message.

Non-Functional Requirements:

	•	Performance: The bookmarklet should perform audits quickly, even on pages with a large DOM.
	•	Security: Ensure that the bookmarklet does not introduce any security risks or interact with sensitive data on the page.
	•	Compatibility: The solution should be compatible with modern browsers and not require additional dependencies outside of the axe-core library.

Benefits:

	•	Efficiency: This tool streamlines accessibility testing by allowing users to audit pages directly from the browser without opening dev tools.
	•	Inclusivity: The user-friendly interface allows both technical and non-technical team members to participate in accessibility testing.
	•	Immediate Feedback: By highlighting violations directly on the webpage, users can immediately identify and focus on problem areas.

Priority: High

Story Points: 8

Additional Notes:

	•	Ensure clear documentation on how to add the bookmarklet to different browsers.
	•	Test the tool across a variety of web pages, including dynamic and single-page applications (SPAs).
